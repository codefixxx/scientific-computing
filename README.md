# 🔢 Scientific Computing – Root Finding Methods

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains MATLAB implementations of fundamental **root-finding algorithms** used in numerical analysis.  
The project demonstrates how different iterative methods approximate the roots of nonlinear equations and compares their **rate of convergence**.

The following methods are implemented:

- **Bisection Method** – Robust interval-halving approach.  
- **Regula Falsi (False Position) Method** – Uses linear interpolation for root estimation.  
- **Newton–Raphson Method** – Fast convergence using tangent lines.  
- **Secant Method** – Approximates the derivative numerically for faster convergence.  
- **Rate of Convergence Analysis** – Compares the order of convergence (`p`) of different methods.
